# jsondiff
yet another json diff that's utility handy for data analysis.

unlike many other json diff utility, you can
* leave out the fields that you are not interested in.
* define required fields
* compare numeric values using a particular precision tolerance e.g. `1e-03`, which can be set globally or per field.
* use regex to ignore/include certain fields for comparison.
